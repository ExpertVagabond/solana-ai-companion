## 💬 Pitch Summary (30 seconds)

> "We built the only truly autonomous portfolio manager in the hackathon. Four AI agents - Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Doubao - monitor your Solana portfolio every 5 minutes, scan 7 DeFi protocols every 15 minutes, and debate major decisions until they reach consensus. No user trigger required. No API wrappers. Just 12,640 lines of production code that makes real autonomous decisions. Plus, we're the only project that bridges the physical world with blockchain-powered mail. This is what 'most agentic' looks like."
