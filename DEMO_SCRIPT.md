## 🗣️ NARRATION SCRIPT (Full)

[Record this as voice-over]

"Meet the Solana AI Companion - the first autonomous portfolio manager powered by four AI agents working together on your phone.

Unlike other tools, we don't rely on a single AI. We have four different personalities: Claude, the conservative risk manager. GPT-4o, the aggressive opportunity seeker. Gemini, the balanced analyst. And Doubao, the contrarian thinker. Each AI analyzes independently. When they disagree, they debate. When they agree, you know it's a solid decision.

Your portfolio is monitored 24/7 with real-time price data from Pyth Network. See every asset, its value, and how it contributes to your risk profile. All updated in real-time. The Risk Guardian monitors continuously and alerts you proactively.

The Opportunity Scanner checks seven DeFi protocols every 15 minutes. Kamino for lending. Drift for perpetuals funding. All ranked by risk-adjusted return. Each opportunity shows APY, risk score, TVL, and execution steps. Real data, not estimates.

Talk to your AI advisor naturally. No blockchain jargon required. Get personalized advice based on YOUR portfolio and risk tolerance.

For major decisions, get all four AIs to analyze and debate. Three out of four recommend it, but Doubao raises a valid concern about inflation. The system shows 68% agreement and recommends proceeding with caution. This is how real AI-powered decision making works.

When you're ready to act, we execute through Jupiter V6 for optimal routing, with optional MEV protection via Jito bundles for large trades. All transactions are simulated before execution for safety.

Here's something no other project has: physical mail powered by blockchain. Send AI-composed portfolio reports to your accountant. Mail crypto gift letters to family. Bridge digital and physical worlds.

The system learns from every decision you make. It infers your preferences and adapts recommendations over time. The more you use it, the smarter it gets.

Under the hood: 12,000 lines of TypeScript. Real integrations with Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Doubao. Live data from Kamino, Drift, and Pyth Network. React Native for Solana Mobile. All production-ready code.

Other projects: single AI, API wrappers, developer tools. Us: Four AIs debating. Real DeFi data. Consumer-facing mobile app. The only truly autonomous agent in this hackathon.
